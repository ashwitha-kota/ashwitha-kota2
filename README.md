This Java code represents a simple grading system that takes user input to gather information about a specified number of students, including their names and scores. It utilizes the Student class, presumably defined elsewhere, to create an array of student objects.

The program prompts the user to input the number of students and then iterates through a loop to collect each student’s name and score. 

The information is stored in the array of Student objects. Finally, the program prints out each student’s name and calculates grades by utilizing the getters from the Student class. The Scanner is used for user input, and the program concludes by closing the scanner.
